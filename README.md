Nodejs_P2P-HandshakeServer
==========================

This project is the counterpart of "phovec", an p2p videochatapp made with WebRTC and emberjs as JavaScript-Framework.
This server-App handles WebRTC-Handshakes and other important delegations on client side.
It uses the Websocket-Protocol to communicate with the clients.

We hope you visit http://phovec.nucular-bacon.com/ to take a look at how "phovec" is going.
